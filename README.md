## Parser
From scratch JavaScript implementation of a w3g parser for WarCraft 3 replay files.
Uses the excellent https://github.com/keichi/binary-parser to parse the replay file.

This parser is aimed to be more modular than other parsers.
You can easily add your custom action parsing logic by overriding the processTimeSlot() function
of a W3GReplay instance.

**It does not fully support replays of game version <= 1.14.**

## Installation
```
  npm install w3gjs
```

## Usage
```javascript
  const W3GReplay = require('w3gjs')
  const Parser = new W3GReplay()
  const replay = Parser.parse('./replays/sample1.w3g')
```

### Example output of the observers.w3g example replay
Check the example_output.json file in the root of this repository.

### Example demo app
You can see the parser in action here and parse your own replays aswell:
