## Parser
From scratch JavaScript implementation of a w3g parser for WarCraft 3 replay files.
Uses the excellent https://github.com/keichi/binary-parser to parse the replay file.

This parser is aimed to be more modular than other parsers.
You can easily add your custom action parsing logic by overriding the processTimeSlot() function
of a W3GReplay instance.

** It does not fully support replays of game version <= 1.14. **

## Usage
```javascript
  //assuming that you cloned this repo into your project
  //sorry, no npm yet ;)
  const W3GReplay = require('./w3gjs')
  const Parser = new W3GReplay('./replays/sample1.w3g')
  const replay = Parser.parse()
```

### example output of the observers.w3g example replay:
```javascript
  To be updated.
```
