# identifier algorithm
In order to detect duplicate replays, an algorithm can be used to determine a unique identifier for each replay file.
That unique identifier must not rely on actual game data or game outcome and must only rely on information that is shared across all game participants regardless of time of replay saving.
Since replays of the same game can differ in binary (players leaving earlier than other players), a file hash is of no use. But one can use existing replay information to construct a hash as follows:

- create a list of all playing players that are NOT observers or referees
- for each player in this list, create a string for each player following this schema: {playername}_{playerid}_{teamid}
- sort the resulting list of strings alphabetically in ascending order
- concat all strings of the sorted list to form a list of player information without spaces
- concat the randomseed string representation with string generated in the previous step and the full map path
- use sha256 to generate a hash of the resulting string of the previous step

## example implementation

```javascript
W3GReplay.prototype.generateID = function () {
  let players = Object.values(this.players).filter((p) => this.isObserver(p) === false).sort((player1, player2) => {
    if (player1.id < player2.id) {
      return -1
    }
    return 1
  }).reduce((accumulator, player) => {
    accumulator += `${player.name}_${player.id}_${player.teamid}`
    return accumulator
  }, '')
  const idBase = this.meta.meta.randomSeed + players + this.meta.mapName
  this.id = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(idBase).digest('hex')
}
```

# matchup algorithm

For a given matchup, the matchup algorithm is supposed to return the same string regardless of player or team order. 
Consider the following example:
* Team1: Undead + Human
* Team0: Orc + Human

The resulting matchup string must be HOvHU

Algorithm:

* for each team, get the first letter of the race of each player and uppercase it
* in that team, sort by race letter ascending
* for each sorted team race combination, sort the team race combinations ascending
* concat the resulting team race combinations with a 'v' to form the final matchup string

```javascript
W3GReplay.prototype.determineMatchup = function () {
  let teamRaces = {}
  Object.values(this.players).forEach((p) => {
    if (!this.isObserver(p)) {
      teamRaces[p.teamid] = teamRaces[p.teamid] || []
      teamRaces[p.teamid].push(p.detectedRace || p.race)
    }
  })
  this.matchup = (Object.values(teamRaces).map(e => e.sort().join(''))).sort().join('v')
}
```
